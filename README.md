## introduction

This is a portfolio that I put together for Jour 320 (Storytelling -- Interactive Journalism). 

Part of my work in this portfolio is data-centered. The main dataset I use centers on traffic crash data from the Chicago Department of Transportation. You can find that dataset [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if/about_data). 

Learn more about how I worked through that dataset [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1coKd7yPY7rrAdyks-8jaxfTQVMEV4NQo9rlRs5He2O8/edit?usp=sharing).
