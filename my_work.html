            In Chicago, there were more than 60,000 traffic crashes in the last six months alone.
            Traffic crashes are a leading cause of death in the United States &mdash; they kill over 120 people every
            day, <a

        <h2>Why Do People Crash?</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding the reasons why people get into traffic accidents is the first step to lowering crash rates,
            making our roads more safe.
        </p>

        <p>
            The city of Chicago provides <a
                href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if/about_data">data</a>
            on citywide traffic crashes, with information from the Chicago Police Department on conditions surrounding
            the crash, location, cause and more.
            After analyzing that data, we found that the most common primary contributory cause to traffic crashes over
            the last six months was failure to yield right of way.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to the <a href="https://ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/documents/062500050K11-904.htm">Illinois General
                Assembly</a>, the police considers a crash to have been caused by failure to yield right of way if a
            driver is "involved in a collision at an intersection or interferes with the movement of other vehicles
            after driving past a yield right-of-way sign," like a stop sign or yield sign.

        <h2>Crashes Caused by Cellphone Use</h2>

        <p>
            Very few crashes over the last six months were primarily attributed to cellphone use &mdash; only about
            0.14% of traffic crashes in the last six months were directly attributed to cellphone use (i.e. texting or
            other cellphone use).
            However, it is important to note that causes of crashes were only known in about 60% of cases. This means
            that it is possible that a greater proportion of crashes were actually caused by cellphone use.
        </p>


        <p>
            Nevertheless, we can see this trend carry through across years — the proportion of traffic crashes that were
            directly attributed to cellphone use tops out at about 0.2% in 2019 and has generally been decreasing in the
            years since.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>
            Despite this trend, campaigns to reduce texting and driving are commonplace in Chicago and across the
            nation. For example, there has been a concerted effort on the part of the Illinois Secretary of State’s
            office to raise awareness about distracted driving.
        </p>

        <p>
            Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias’s office <a
                href="https://www.ilsos.gov/news/2024/october/241021d1.pdf">launched a campaign</a> last October called
            “One Road. One Focus” that includes a new requirement for teens with a learner's permit to watch a video on
            the consequences of distracted driving before they receive their driver’s license.
        </p>

        <p>
            Concerns around cellphone use while driving may stem not from the number of accidents cellphone use causes,
            but from the severity of accidents that were a result of cellphone use.
        </p>

        <p>
            We found that crashes that were caused by cellphone use tended to result in significantly higher rates of
            injury. About 30% of those in cellphone-related crashes were injured, vs. about 16% across all types of
            crashes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ultimately, cellphone-related crashes are avoidable crashes. We saw that cellphone-related crash rates have
            been decreasing since 2019, possibly pointing to the effectiveness of Chicago's efforts to curb distracted
            driving.
            Even at its lowest, though, there were still more than 150 cellphone-related crashes in Chicago.
        </p>

        <p>
            State legislators have been active in introducing new policy surrounding distracted driving. Just last year,
            <a
                href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/billstatus.asp?DocNum=2431&GAID=17&GA=103&DocTypeID=HB&LegID=147512&SessionID=112&SpecSess=">a
                bill</a> went into effect that
            makes it illegal for people to participate in a video conference or access social media while driving.

        <h1>Methodology</h1>

        <p>
            My work for this project came from two samples of data from the Chicago Data Portal called <a href = "https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if/about_data">"Traffic Crashes - Crashes"</a>. 
            This is a dataset comprised of data on traffic crashes compiled by the Chicago Police Department, with citywide data available after September 2017. 
            The dataset includes info on crash location, environmental conditions during the crash and injuries sustained. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            The first sample of data I took from this dataset was all traffic crashes that took place between August 2024 and February 24, 2025. 
            I conducted exploratory analysis in Google Sheets to see where stories may lie in this dataset. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            Broadly, I explored the following categories:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How do crash rates vary over time? (months, day of the week, hour)</li>
                <li>How do crash rates vary based on safety measures on the road? (speed limit, roadway type, etc.)</li>
                <li>How do crash rates vary depending on environmental factors? (weather, amount of daylight, etc.)</li>
                <li>What types of crashes are we seeing? (ex. severe crashes vs non-severe, rear ends, what is the crash caused by, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            I did find some inconsistencies in terms of data entry; whenever this impacted any of the data I reference in my article, I add it in a footnote.
        </p>

        <p>
            This helped me narrow my scope to crashes caused by cellphone use. I saw that cellphone use was at the bottom when it came to what most often ended up causing traffic crashes, which I thought was surprising given the amount of messaging aimed at young people surrounding texting and driving &mdash; I would have thought distracted driving crashes made up a larger proportion of all crashes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This ended up pushing me to query the traffic crash data again, as I wanted to see how cellphone-related crashes varied over the years (if you remember, my initial dataset only covered the last six months).
            I ended up having to use the Chicago Data Portal's site to do some of the processing here since Google Sheets wasn't able to handle the huge amount of data &mdash; this process as well as the rest of my processing work is laid out in detail in <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1coKd7yPY7rrAdyks-8jaxfTQVMEV4NQo9rlRs5He2O8/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.zdcdi17tdaiv">this document</a> (you can also view my spreadsheet there).

        <h1>AI Declaration</h1>

        <p>
        I used AI to add the hover styling on my navbar (when a user hovers over the link, it changes color). 
        Learning to do this made me realize that styling could be triggered by user action, not just the type of content I was styling. 
        I hope to incorporate more features like this in my future work.
